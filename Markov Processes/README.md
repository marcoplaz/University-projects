This project, titled "Processus Markov & Applications: Jumping Electrons Model," explores the use of Markov processes in atomic chemistry, focusing specifically on the behavior of the first 10 elements of the Periodic Table. It applies the memoryless nature of Markov models to simulate and analyze stochastic phenomena such as electron transitions and atomic state changes. The objective is to better understand atomic behavior and improve predictions of chemical outcomes by quantifying the probabilistic nature of interactions at the atomic and molecular levels.
