# Synthesis: Deep Optimal Stopping Project

## Title
**ML Theoretical Foundation: An Analysis of ‘Deep Optimal Stopping’**

## Overview

This project analyzes the paper *“Deep Optimal Stopping”*, which explores the classical stochastic control problem of optimal stopping through the lens of modern deep learning techniques. The problem, relevant in areas such as American option pricing and sequential decision-making, involves determining the optimal time to stop a stochastic process in order to maximize expected reward. The reviewed paper proposes a framework where **neural networks** are trained to approximate optimal stopping rules, effectively addressing the challenges posed by **high-dimensional** settings.

## Objectives

The main goal is to develop a **deep learning-based method** that can efficiently and accurately estimate optimal stopping policies for high-dimensional Markov processes. The method integrates:
- Dynamic programming principles
- Monte Carlo simulations
- Deep neural network approximators

It aims to overcome the curse of dimensionality that affects traditional methods and provide robust confidence bounds for the estimated stopping values.

## Key Contributions

- The authors model optimal stopping as a sequence of binary decisions, learned through backward training of neural networks.
- They provide theoretical guarantees for the approximation quality of the neural networks and for the numerical stability of the recursive learning method.
- Statistical tools are introduced to estimate **lower and upper bounds**, **point estimates**, and **confidence intervals** of the optimal stopping value.
- The methodology is tested on high-dimensional examples: **Bermudan max-call options**, **multi-barrier reverse convertibles**, and **fractional Brownian motion**.

## Critical Analysis

The students highlight the **relevance** of the method as it extends classical tools like the Snell envelope and dynamic programming to modern machine learning. Compared to older techniques like the **Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm**, this approach scales well with dimension (even up to 500), without sacrificing accuracy. It also aligns with policy-based reinforcement learning strategies.

Limitations noted include:
- The need for large-scale simulation data.
- Sensitivity to neural network architecture and training parameters.
- Absence of a proper conclusion section in the paper, leaving broader insights to the reader.

## Observations and Results

- In all tested cases, the **gap between upper and lower bounds was minimal**, suggesting high-quality approximations.
- The method demonstrated **linear computational scalability**, a crucial advantage in high-dimensional problems.
- Training time remained low even with increasing dimensions, confirming the method’s practicality.

## Conclusion

This project offers a rigorous and insightful review of an advanced approach to optimal stopping using deep learning. It shows how classic probabilistic tools can be combined with neural network approximators to solve problems that were previously intractable due to dimensionality constraints. The paper is an important contribution to both **applied probability** and **machine learning**, and the students’ analysis reflects a strong understanding of the theoretical and practical implications of the work.
